# OCTOCAT GITHUB PULL DEMO

1. Create Project
2. Create Github Remote Repository
3. Commit Project to remote repository
    - `git add.`
    - `git commit -m "Your Message Here"`
    - `git remote add origin <YOUR GITHUB REPO LINK HERE>`
    - `git push origin master`
4. To pull down changes from remote repository
    - `git pull <remote>(origin) <branch>(master)`
    This assumes only one remote and one branch. If multiple branches and/or remotes are present, then you will need to specify which branch/remote you would like to use.
